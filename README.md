**General Information**

In this project, I have used React to create a resume builder in which the user is able to input their information (i.e personal info, professional experience, etc.), use the 'preview' button sporadically to preview the final product and print to PDF once completed. This was the first app that I created with React and I had some major struggles but I found that properly planning prior helped alot in the development process. I learned so much about React, how to run and integrate the create-react-app command, how to use components, state and props for reusability of components, and so much more. Buildng this app showed me how structured a React app can be and how dynamically information can be displayed on a page with reusable components.
